            Hi, my name is <b>Kartik</b> and I am from Sonipat,Haryana,
            India. I'm a <b> web developer</b> and a Third year
            university student pursuing <b>Bachelors in Computer Science</b>. <br />
            <br />
            I love to create projects with beautiful designs and put my own
            twists on it, you can check out some of my work in the projects
            section.
            <br />
            <br />I am <b>open</b> to new collaborations or work where I can
            contribute and grow. Feel free to connect with me, links are in the
            footer.
            <br />
            Apart from coding I love to deep-dive into other people ideas ,and do
            gym or listen music in my spare time.
